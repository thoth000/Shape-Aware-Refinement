# Shape-Aware Refinement

## Paper / Slides

## Overview
This research proposes a PDE-based refinement module for vessel segmentation to enhance shape continuity.

- PDE-based refinement improves mask continuity
- Our approach is applied to various architectures for tubular-structure segmentation

## Dataset
- [DRIVE dataset](https://github.com/zhengyuan-liu/Retinal-Vessel-Segmentation/tree/master/DRIVE)
